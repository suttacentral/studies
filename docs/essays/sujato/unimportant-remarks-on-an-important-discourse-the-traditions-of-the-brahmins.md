The BrƒÅhma·πáadhammika (Snp 2.7) is a powerful and distinctive narrative that tells of the decline of the brahmins and the origin of the sacrifice. It shares something in common with the sprawling mythic narratives of the Digha, but is much more focussed.

The Buddha I asked by some senior brahmins whether their contemporaries maintain the traditions of old, and the Buddha says no. This is in line with his position elsewhere, where he tends to treat the current brahmins as lesser sons of greater fathers. Sometimes, on the other hand, he dismisses the traditions altogether, arguing that even the composers of the Vedas knew nothing.

The description of the brahmins of old is similar to that found in, say, the Agga√±√±a Sutta. For example, it‚Äôs emphasized how they did not store food but relied on alms. This allows the Buddha to position his own followers as ‚Äúmore brahmin than the brahmins‚Äù.

According to the story, they used to practice the *brahmacariya* for 48 years. This is evidently a reference to an early idea about the stages of life that was later codified. The notion appears elsewhere, where the term *komarabrahmacariya* appears (an5.192:5.4), evidently having the sense of ‚Äúcelibacy since youth‚Äù i.e. ‚Äúvirginity‚Äù. *Komara* is added in brackets here, a very unusual intrusion in the text. It‚Äôs probably inserted from the commentary by parallel with the prose. Nevertheless, it seems the sense is justified.

This text is that it adopts the point of view of the brahmins and their values in a way that‚Äôs understandable given the context, but nonetheless can seem jarring. The Buddha, listing what he appears to be endorsing as the good practices of old, refers to the brahmins not marrying outside of caste, or avoiding sex during the ‚Äúinfertile period‚Äù. ([I have discussed this in more detail here.](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/menstruation-and-fertility-in-the-pali-texts/3042)) This tendency becomes especially strong at the end when the Buddha is said to describe them as having ‚Äúfallen away from the doctrine of caste‚Äù (*JƒÅtivƒÅda·πÅ nirƒÅkatvƒÅ*). I don't know, it makes me a little uncomfortable.

Moving on, there are a few mistakes in earlier translations. Seeing as someone recently asked about Ven Thanissaro‚Äôs translations, I'll include them here to see what turns up.

In verse 16 we find *kiccƒÅkiccesu*, translated by Norman as ‚Äúwhat was to be done and what was not to be done‚Äù, by Bodhi as ‚Äúwhat was to be done and not done‚Äù, and by Thanissaro as ‚Äúwhat should & shouldn‚Äôt be done‚Äù. But this is an idiomatic phrase of a kind not uncommon in Pali. *PhalƒÅphala* means ‚Äúall kinds of fruit‚Äù, *bhavƒÅbhava* means ‚Äúall kinds of rebirths‚Äù. *KiccƒÅkicca* likewise means ‚Äúall kinds of business‚Äù, as is clear from cases such as Thag 16.10:20.2. Here‚Äôs PƒÅrƒÅpariya‚Äôs rather memorable description of the monks of his days.

>*Bhesajjesu yathƒÅ vejjƒÅ,*  
>In medicine they are like doctors,  
>*kiccƒÅkicce yathƒÅ gihƒ´*  
>in business like householders,  
>*Ga·πáikƒÅva vibh≈´sƒÅya·πÅ,*  
>in makeup like prostitutes,  
>*issare khattiyƒÅ yathƒÅ.*  
>in sovereignty like lords.

At Snp 2.7:18.4 there‚Äôs an interesting line used to describe the houses of the wealthy:

>*Vibhatte bhƒÅgaso mite*  
>Neatly laid out in measured rows.

Elsewhere the same phrase is used to describe the gates of hell. (AN 3.36:16.2). Evidently the Buddha was no great fan of the suburbs.

***

At Snp 2.7:20.1 it says that the brahmins fooled the kings with new scriptures. The Pali verb is *gantheti* (‚Äúhave tied‚Äù), which in later use literally means to ‚Äúwrite a book‚Äù (i.e. a *grantha*). The usage here in this sense is unusual, and I think it‚Äôs earlier than any other case. The commentary is highly polemical and says they deliberately composed new scriptures. 

But I'm not 100% sure that the text justifies this. I wonder whether it could mean ‚Äúselecting‚Äù passages, i.e. ‚Äúmaking a compilation‚Äù. We know that this is a very common if not normal practice. 

It‚Äôs a lot easier to select some amenable passages to support your case than it is to create a whole new scripture. It‚Äôs hard work! You have to compose the lines, organize it, make it appear authentic, and co-ordinate all this among a group of like-minded co-conspirators. 

Reading it as ‚Äúcompiling‚Äù rather than composing is both more historically plausible and gentler on the brahmins.

***

The root that makes sacrifice possible is the king‚Äôs excessive wealth. The underlying psychology is that inequality breeds jealousy and corruption. The king is encouraged to ‚Äúburn off‚Äù his wealth in a display of conspicuous consumption. 

This is, in fact, a legitimate anthropological theory of the origin of sacrifice (or at least one of them). In Melanesia, for example, the villages would have a ‚Äúbig man‚Äù who over time would gather greater shares of the village wealth, primarily pigs. At a certain point it would become unmanageable; what do you do with so many pigs? So they'd hold a great feast to which neighboring big men would be invited. It'd be an occasion to assert dominance and expand circles of influence. 

The specifics of the sacrifice vary from place to place, but there must always be one thing that they share: [someone has too much stuff and something has to give](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/07/elon-musk-overtakes-amazon-bezos-world-richest-person-tesla-bloomberg-billionare-index-blue-senate).

***

The text says that the brahmins had the king sacrifice ‚Äúmany hundreds of thousands‚Äù of cattle. No doubt this is an exaggeration, but it‚Äôs not as unbelievable as it may sound. Sacrifices on this scale have been performed in modern times.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival

We educated moderns may see talk of animal sacrifice as a peculiar, alien, or primitive rite, but it is still an ongoing reality in much of the world. The Buddha‚Äôs movement to stamp it out is still in progress.

***

I confess, I get a little teary at the climax of this sutta, the thought of the poor gentle cows being slaughtered for no reason. üò¢ 

The Buddha depicts the brahmanical deities as being outraged by this, roaring out *adhamma!* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs against the Dhamma!‚Äù Norman has ‚Äú(this is ) injustice!‚Äù, Bodhi ‚ÄúHow unrighteous!‚Äù, Thanissaro ‚ÄúAn injustice!‚Äù. None of these, I feel, capture the force of the original. I have:

>At that the gods and the ancestors,  
>with Indra, the titans and monsters,  
>roared out: ‚ÄòThis is a crime against nature!‚Äô  
>as the sword fell on the cows.
