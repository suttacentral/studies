reasonHeader: Why translate Pali texts?
reasons:
  - header: Our job is not finished
    text: Since the 19th century, scholars have worked to translate important Pali texts into English. But several canonical texts and most of the commentaries are still untranslated. We aim to fill this gap.
  - header: Lift the field
    text: The study of Buddhist texts is a difficult and vast field with few resources. Without accurate translations, it is hard for study to make progress.
  - header: Translate all remaining canonical texts
    text: Certain texts of the Pali Tipiṭaka have not been translated into English. In other cases, the translations are unavailble, or in need of improvement. 
  - header: Translate all the commentaries
    text: Only a few of the ancient commentaries  (<i>aṭṭhakathā</i>) have been translated. We aim to translate all the commentaries, which provide an essential link between the Buddha’s day and our own.
  - header: Improve understanding of Pali
    text: The process of translation exposes innumerable questions and challenges, and dealing with these expands our knowledge of Pali.
  - header: Make available one of the world’s great spiritual literatures
    text: The Pali commentaries, derived from Indian sources and developed in Sri Lanka, form one of the largest and most coherent bodies of spiritual exegisis from ancient times.
